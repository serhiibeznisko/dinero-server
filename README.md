# Requirements to start project
    - docker
    - docker-compose 

Recommended, but not needed:

    - Linux System
    - make
    
 
# Development
    - make run
    - make migrate
    - make populatedb

If you don't have make program in your system, copy commands manually from Makefile and write them into your terminal.

After that you will have fully working development environment with initial sample campaign.

Try to log in to http://localhost:8001/management/admin with your previously created admin credentials and check out how it does work.
